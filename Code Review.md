# Code Review

> ⚠️ We're currently porting some of this projects files, which is why some thing might not work as expected!

Help us review our code by checking our main files, including

- php
- javascript (*this includes node.js, vue.js, alpine.js, angular.js and/or react.js*) 
- css (*this includes SASS, LESS, bootstrap, tailwind and/or other frameworks used*)

for **errors** or **inadequate quality**.

## Errors

### Syntax errors

We automatically check our code for syntax errors before it is compiled and/or pushed to a Git Repo. 
Anyways, syntax errors can happen, especially if PRs are merged into a repo or anything happens in a rush. 
Therefore feel free to check the syntax of our code and open an issue or make a pull request if you notice anything wrong with the code.

### Formal errors

It can happen that something *formally* is wrong but works regardless. 
If you notice anything like this in our code, please open an issue or fix the error and make a pull request. 

## Inadequate quality

**Please note that we're currently in the proccess of modernizing our code.** This means that some of the following quality guidelines are not fulfilled.
Feel free to contribute and help us with our modernizing proccess. 

### Missing comments

Anything should be annotated, so everyone can understand our code. 
If there are comments missing, feel free to add them and make a pull request or open an issue.

### Untidied code

Code should always be tidied up before committing. 
If you notice untidied code, please open an issue or fix it yourself and make a pull request.

### Missing feedback

Commits into the main-branch of a repo should be checked by at least two people before they're added. 
If you notice missing feedback on a commit, please immediately open an issue. 

### Bad execution

Sometimes something is just a work-arround or quick fix that belongs into a seperate shame-file.
Main files however should **not** include something like this and should be **appropriately written/coded**.
If you spot anything like this, please feel free to fix it and make a pull request or open an issue.
